# Facial_Expression_Recognition_usingkeras
In this project I built and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) in Keras from scratch to recognize facial expressions. The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. The objective is to classify each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral). I used openCV to automatically detect faces in images and draw bounding boxes around them. Once the model istrained and saved, and exported the CNN, you can will directly serve the trained model predictions to a web interface and perform real-time facial expression recognition on video and image data.
